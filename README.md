# Real-Time Face Recognition with KNN

This project demonstrates a real-time face recognition system using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm with OpenCV. It includes steps to collect face data, train the model, and perform real-time face recognition via webcam.

## üöÄ Features

- Real-time face detection using Haar Cascades
- Data collection from webcam (selfies)
- Face data preprocessing and organization
- Face recognition using a simple KNN classifier
- Jupyter Notebooks to showcase each step clearly

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### üì¶ Installation

Use pip to install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib
```

## üì∏ Usage Guide

### 1. Data Collection
Run `generating selfies.ipynb` to collect selfies using your webcam. These will be saved in `selfies_training_data/`.

### 2. Face Detection
Use `face detection using haarCascades.ipynb` to verify if face detection works correctly with your setup.

### 3. Training & Prediction
Open `predicting name from face .ipynb` to process collected data and train a KNN model to recognize the faces.

### 4. Real-Time Face Recognition
Launch `OpenCV-working with video stream from webcam.ipynb` to see the real-time recognition in action.

## üìå Notes

- Ensure proper lighting during data collection for best results.
- You can increase the number of images per person to improve accuracy.
